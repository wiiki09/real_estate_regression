## The Mission
The real estate company "ImmoEliza" ask you to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's sales.

Take the dataset previously scraped, preprocessed and analyzed. Preprocess the data to be used with machine learning.

You have to handle NANs
You have to handle categorical data
You have to select features
You have to remove features that have too strong correlation

## Mission objectives
* Apply a linear regression in a real context.
* Preprocess data for machine learning.

## Dataset selection
The first day of the project was spent on evaluating and selecting datasets, with the help of the pandas-profiling module.
In the end we settled on the most complete dataset even though it had the least observations.
It meant we lost possibly predictive features like the number of facades.
